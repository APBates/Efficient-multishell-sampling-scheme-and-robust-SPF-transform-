As related to the results shown in the paper:


plotting_synthetic_evaluation_1_fibre.m 
- generates the plots of NRMSE in the paper for the single fibre and varying FA. These results are generated by syn_eval_1_fibre...(SNR5 etc)

plotting_synthetic_evaluation_2_fibres.m
-  generates the plots of NRMSE in the paper for two fibres and varying crossing angle. These results are generated by syn_eval_2_fibre_...(SNR5 etc)



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the syn_eval_mat_file_generating_scripts folder

syn_eval_2_fibre_...(SNR10 etc) - once run just have for single SNR
- Used to test NRMSE as a function of fibre crossing angle for 2 fibres (1 fibre for 0 crossing case)
- Does this for regularised LS and the proposed regularisation method
- Also does for the proposed method with denoising

denoised_syn_eval_2_fibre...(SNR10 etc)
- Also does for the proposed method with denoising

LS_syn_eval_2_fibre_denoised...(SNR10 etc)
- for LS with denoising

syn_eval_1_fibre...(SNR10 etc)
- Used to test NRMSE as a function of FA for fibre
- Does this for regularised LS and the proposed regularisation method

denoised_syn_eval_1_fibre...(SNR10 etc)
- Also does for the proposed method with denoising

LS_syn_eval_1_fibre_denoised...(SNR10 etc)
- for LS with denoising

In the process_real_data folder (some of this is code given to me by Erick). The main two functions are:

read_data_and_save_ODF_samples.m
- reads in data
- calls create_ODF_in_q_space.m
- saves ODF samples


create_ODF_in_q_space.m
- function to work out the ODFs at the slice specified 


run_plot_ODF_slice.m 
- Script to plot the fODF in a brain slice
- Need to specify the x,y,z indices of the slice want to display the ODFs of (should correspond to slice created in create_ODF_in_space.m

LS_create_ODF_in_q_space.m
- Least-squares version of the above
